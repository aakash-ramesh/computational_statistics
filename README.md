# Computational Statistics Models

This repository contains models and implementations developed as part of my coursework in Computational Statistics at Georgia Tech.  
The focus is on understanding and applying core statistical learning and inference techniques through hands-on model building and experimentation.

The notebooks and scripts in this repository cover a wide range of topics in computational statistics and machine learning, including:

- **Regularization Methods:** Lasso, Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net  
- **Nonparametric Regression:** Splines and Smoothing Splines  
- **Density Estimation & Kernel Methods:** Kernel Density Estimation, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)  
- **Latent Variable Models:** Hidden Markov Models (HMM)  
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- **Recommendation Systems:** Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization  
- **Simulation & Inference:** Monte Carlo Methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)  
- **Ensemble Learning:** Bagging, Boosting, Random Forests  
- **Resampling Techniques:** Bootstrap Methods  
- **Neural Networks:** Basic feedforward networks for function approximation
